# Climate Training Flow

Trains ML models on historical climate data to predict temperature changes, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events.

This flow loads historical data and trains three models:
- Temperature predictor (Transformer)
- Precipitation predictor (LSTM)
- Extreme events classifier (XGBoost)
